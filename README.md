# Python_project5--Visualizing-The-Gender-Gap-In-College-Degrees
Project:Visualizing The Gender Gap In College DegreesÂ¶ In this project, we will generate line charts to compare across all degree categories. We'll explore how to export the final diagram we create as an image file.
The data as been collected from US college bachelors degrees. It contain percentage of women in those subjects from 1970 till 2011.

It date file has 44 rows and 18 columns:

- Year,
- Agriculture,
- Architecture,
- Art and Performance,
- Biology,
- Business,
- Communications and Journalism,
- Computer Science,
- Education,
- Engineering,
- English,
- Foreign Languages,
- Health Professions,
- Math and Statistics,
- Physical Sciences,
- Psychology,
- Public Administration,
- Social Sciences and History

These are the steps taken for the projects:
#### 1. Understanding the data
lets visualize few categories as line chart to understand the data.
#### 2. Comparing across all degree categories
Because there are seventeen degrees that we need to generate line charts for, we'll use a subplot grid layout of 6 rows by 3 columns. We can then group the degrees into STEM, liberal arts, and other and then create a diagram for thses categories.
#### 3. Hiding x-axis labels
Now, The most immediate issue that sticks out is the titles of some line charts overlapping with the x-axis labels for the line chart above it. If we remove the titles for each line chart, the viewer won't know what degree each line chart refers to. Let's instead remove the x-axis labels for every line chart in a column except for the bottom most one.
#### 4. Setting y-axis labels
In the vein of reducing cluttering, let's also simplify the y-axis labels.Currently, all seventeen plots have six y-axis labels and even though they are consistent across the plots, they still add to the visual clutter. By keeping just the starting and ending labels (0 and 100), we can keep some of the benefits of having the y-axis labels to begin with by using Axes.set_yticks() method.
#### 5. Adding a horizontal line
While removing most of the y-axis labels definitely reduced clutter, it also made it hard to understand which degrees have close to 50-50 gender breakdown. While keeping all of the y-axis labels would have made it easier, we can actually do one better and use a horizontal line across all of the line charts where the y-axis label 50 would have been.
We can generate a horizontal line across an entire subplot using the Axes.axhline() method. The only required parameter is the y-axis location for the start of the line: ax.axhline(50).
#### 6. Exporting to a file
Matplotlib can be used many different ways. Many these of ways of using matplotlib vary in workflow and handle the rendering of images differently as well.To help support these different use cases, matplotlib can target different outputs or backends. If you import matplotlib and run matplotlib.get_backend(), you'll see the specific backend you're currently using.

For eg: With the jupyter notebook backend, we can use __Figure.savefig()__ or __pyplot.savefig()__ to export all of the plots contained in the figure as a single image file. Note that these have to be called before we display the figure using pyplot.show().:
__plt.plot(women_degrees['Year'], women_degrees['Biology'])
plt.savefig('biology_degrees.png')__

In the last part of the code, we saved a line chart as a PNG file. Exporting plots we create using matplotlib allows us to use them in Word documents, Powerpoint presentations, and even in emails.
